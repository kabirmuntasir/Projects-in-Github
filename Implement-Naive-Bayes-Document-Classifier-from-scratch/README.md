# Implement-Naive-Bayes-Document-Classifier-from-scratch
Our task was to implement Naive Bayes for document classification. The 20 Newsgroups dataset is a collection of approximately 20,000 newsgroup documents, partitioned (nearly) evenly across 20 different newsgroups.   Our implemented classifier can classify 83.55 % documents correctly.
